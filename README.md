# Web3 Fundraising Platform 

Raise funds for your projects/campaigns with ethereum as the native currency

Users can create a campaign and give title, description, target amount, goal date, and an image. The campaign will be displayed on the home page of all users. 
To fund a certain project, users can click on the project and can enter the amount they want to contribute. Users will need some test ETH to contribute(gas fees).
All the ETH received by a project will automatically be sent to the address corresponding to the campaign's creator.
